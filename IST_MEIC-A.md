# IST Course Projects: MEIC-A / MSc CSE

This is a portfolio of the projects I developed for my Master's Degree in Computer Science and Engineering at [Instituto Superior Técnico](https://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/), University of Lisbon.

I specialized in Software Engineering and Distributed Systems, and also did some courses on Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity, and Engineering and Data Science.
